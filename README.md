# SOLAS Custom Levels
A BepinEx plugin for SOLAS 128 that allows for the loading of custom levels into the game.
## Level Loading
To load a level, first create a .lvl file somewhere and set it's path in the plugins config file. The format of this file can be found in [levelstructure.md](https://github.com/frankm1870/SOLAS-Custom-Levels/blob/main/levelstructure.md).
Along with the level file, a .zone file can be used to modify the zones used to determine background color and music.
